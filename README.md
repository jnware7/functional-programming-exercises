# Functional Programming Exercises

Introductory exercises on functional programming concepts using JavaScript.

Base repository for the [Functional Programming: Concepts and Exercises](http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/110) goal.

## Getting Started

The exercises are organized into subdirectories. Peek around the file structure to get a sense for how things are laid out.

Then, when you're ready to start:

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Install npm packages with `npm install`
4. Run your tests with `npm test`
5. Work on an exercise
6. Make the tests pass
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for big fun


# Part 1 Exercises for Mostly Adequate Guide

Excercises and tests sourced from [Mostly adequate guide to FP][mag]: [code/part1_exercises](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/tree/master/code/part1_exercises).

# Katas from Code Wars

Solutions to [CodeWars][codewars] functional programming katas in JavaScript. See the [full list][codewars-chals] (must have an account).

Add your solution code to subdirectories with the format `kata-name/solution.js`. An example is provided at `functional-sql/solution.js`.

If you want to write tests, you can use `chai` and `mocha`. These libraries are already a part of the dependencies (see the `package.json` file at root). To make sure that `npm test` picks up your test files, just make sure your test files end in `_spec.js`, for example `functional-sql_spec.js`.
